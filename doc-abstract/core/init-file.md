Init file
==============
2016-12-02



The init file contains the basic configuration of a **nullos admin** application.



Only one **init file** is used by **nullos admin**, either

- the "user" init file **app-nullos/init.php**
- the "fallback" init file **app-nullos/init-fallback.php**, which is only used if the "user" init file is not present
  
  

A fresh install of **nullos admin** only contains the "fallback" init.

The "user" init file can be created manually, or with the 
help of the <-Boot module->.
