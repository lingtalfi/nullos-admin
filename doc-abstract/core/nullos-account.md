Nullos account
======================
2016-11-30





In nullos admin, some pages and/or actions require elevated privileges.



A nullos account holds all the privileges for a user during her session.

A pseudo/password pair is required to log into a nullos account.
 
 
This pseudo/password pair is provided via the nullos log in screen (see screenshot below).
