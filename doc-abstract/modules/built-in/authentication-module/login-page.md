2016-11-30



The login page is the entry point of the **nullos admin** website (see the screenshot below).



<!-login-screen->


It appears every time a user is not connected to her <-nullos account->.
 
 
The <-Authentication module-> is responsible for creating the **nullos account** which contains the login pseudo/password pair.
