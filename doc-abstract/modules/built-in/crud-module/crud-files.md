Crud file(s)
===============
2016-11-30 -- 2016-12-03



**Crud files** are part of the <-Crud module->.

They help interacting with the front website(s) database(s).


The **crud file** is the php file which displays the form or the list for a given table.


There are two types of crud files:

- list crud files, which display the list
- form crud files, which can display both the "insert form" or "update form"


Inside the Crud module, a **crud file** is always called by the <-crud page->.


A **crud file** can be created by hand, or be generated by the **crud generators** (for instance via the <-"Crud Generators" page->).



To learn how to create a **crud file** from scratch, please refer to the
<-configure a list-> page,
or the <-configure a form-> page.
