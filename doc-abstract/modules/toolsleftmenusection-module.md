ToolsLeftMenuSection module
=====================
2016-12-25


The **ToolsLeftMenuSection module** works together with the <-layout module->.

It handles the "Tools" left menu section part.


All the links that you see in the "Tools" section of the left menu of the <-main nullos layout->
have subscribed to this module.

If you need to add your own tool, you will probably use its displayToolsLeftMenuLinks service.
