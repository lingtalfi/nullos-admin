Install a module tutorial
====================================
2016-12-26



In this tutorial, we learn how to install a module.

In nullos, modules can do anything.

One special built-in module in nullos is called the <-ModuleInstaller module->.

This module provides you with a gui to install/uninstall the modules.



Install a module
====================

Click the "ModuleInstaller" link on the left menu in the "Tools" section.

You will land on the Module installer page (see screenshot below).


<!-Module installer gui page->


You will see the list of the available modules.

If the module can be installed (meaning it has an installer), then there will be an install/uninstall link
next to its name.

Click on the "install" link to install the module.




Did you think it would be more complicated than that? 
Well, sorry it's not.

For more info about the module installer, please visit the <-ModuleInstaller module page->.
