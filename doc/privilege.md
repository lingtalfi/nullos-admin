Privilege
=================
2016-11-23


nullos use the [Privilege](https://github.com/lingtalfi/Privilege) framework.


As far as the crud module is concerned, my first intent was to use Privilege for every single sql privilege.
That may be a todo..., but for now, my client doesn't need it, so just use the sql language directly if that's something
you need.
