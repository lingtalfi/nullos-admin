Nullos admin vs phpMyAdmin
===============================
2016-11-27



In this document, I want to talk about what I think are the resemblances and differences between nullos admin and phpMyAdmin.


Both "programs" allow to interact with some databases, but phpMyAdmin goes far deeper: it offers tons of functionalities and options, 
whereas nullos admin focuses more on the surface of the things: the appearance, the look'n'feel.


I personally use phpMyAdmin when I develop, and I prefer it over nullos.
 
It's simple to use because there is a direct correlation between the databases and the gui: what you see is what you get, it's straightforward.

Plus, phpMyAdmin has an awful lot of functionalities: you can export/import the database in various ways, you can manage
all the aspects of your tables: it's a complete management tool and is perfect for developers.


So, why did I create nullos admin then?

The only resemblance that nullos admin has compared to phpMyAdmin is that it can do basic crud operations: select, update, insert, delete.

That's it.

However, here is the gotcha.

The problem I had with phpMyAdmin didn't come from me (I am perfectly happy with phpMyAdmin), but from my client.

I first proposed phpMyAdmin as the backend interface for her website to my client.

My client found that it was too complicated, and she didn't want to use it: she was scared.

Therefore, I created nullos admin with the sole goal of her being able to use it without freaking out.


So here is the main difference for me:
 
- phpMyAdmin was designed for developers, and it has tons of options
- nullos admin is designed for website administrators/moderators with little to no technical knowledge, it has almost no functionalities or options


The only advantage that I believe nullos has over phpMyAdmin is how it lets you go in greater details when configure the aspect of the tables and forms.

Basically, you can rename or hide any column in your tables and forms. That's perhaps the only thing I didn't found in phpMyAdmin.
