TODO...

The QuickStart module helps the user getting started with nullos admin.

It provides help for the following:

- creating the init.php file
- crud generator configuration




Creating the init.php file
----------------------
The QuickStart module detects the presence of the **app/init.php** script in your app.

On a fresh install, this script is not there, it has to be created by the QuickStart module (
or by you manually if you know what to create).

If the **app/init.php** file is not there, you will be automatically redirected to the quick start page,
which goal is to help you getting started with the nullos admin in less than one minute.

Just follow the instructions on the quick start page. 
 



Privileges
----------------

The following privileges are defined by the QuickStart module:

- quickstart.access: if you don't have it, you can't do anything...
    - display the quickstart links section on the left menu
    - allow access to the quickstart pages
