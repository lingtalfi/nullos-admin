In nullos, the Layout is a helper to display a [page](https://github.com/lingtalfi/nullos-admin/tree/master/doc/official/core-concepts/routing/create-page.md).


Using a Layout helps creating pages that look consistent across the website.


A Layout is composed of **layout elements**, each of which containing a part of the html that might 
vary from page to page.

The Layout itself contains the html that doesn't vary at all.


A **layout element** is a php file included by the layout.

All the **layout elements** files are in the **app-nullos/layout-elements** directory.
