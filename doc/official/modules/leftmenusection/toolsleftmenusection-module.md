ToolsLeftMenuSection module
============================
2016-12-02


This module creates the "Tools" left menu section of the main nullos layout.

However, it doesn't provide the links itself, but delegates the job of creating the links to the modules
 via the [Bridge](https://github.com/lingtalfi/nullos-admin/tree/master/doc/official/core-concepts/bridge.md)'s displayToolsLeftMenuLinks method.
 

 
The ToolsLeftMenuSection module itself is located in **app-nullos/class-modules/LeftMenuSection/Tools/ToolsLeftMenuSectionModule.php**.
