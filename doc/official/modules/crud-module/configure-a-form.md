Configure a form
====================
2016-12-01



Nullos admin's power lies in the ability to let you configure the forms how you want.

There are a lot of options, which are all discussed in this page.

This long page is meant to be read in a linear way, as the examples shown are built on top of the previous ones.


The configuration of a form is done by opening and editing a form [crud file](https://github.com/lingtalfi/nullos-admin/tree/master/doc/official/modules/crud-module/crud-file.md).

Preparation
===============

In the examples below, I will be using the "oui" database.

Instructions on how to install the "oui" database are found in the [Install the "oui" database tutorial](https://github.com/lingtalfi/nullos-admin/tree/master/doc/tutorials/install-oui-database.md).

I will also generate some basic **crud files** using the Quickstart [Crud Generators](https://github.com/lingtalfi/nullos-admin/tree/master/doc/official/modules/quickstart-module/crud-generators-page.md) menu item.

Then, I will create a **app-nullos/crud/list/oui.concours.php** file and work all my examples from there (unless otherwise specified).
