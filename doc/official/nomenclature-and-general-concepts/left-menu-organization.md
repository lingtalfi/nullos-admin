Left menu organization
=========================
2016-12-02


In progress...


It is part of the core intent to design the left menu layout of the **nullos admin**.

The following left menu elements structure has been chosen for the nullos admin's main layout:


- Tools: contains links to tools, independent of and/or specific to the website to administer
- Website: contains links to the lists and forms that allow the client to administer her website
    - basically, this part is mostly auto-generated thanks to the <-Crud Generators->
- Plugins: will contain gui configurable items that enhance the website (contact form, forum, ...)
    - the name plugin comes from the fact that the items plug in some tables in a host database in order
        to provide their configuration
