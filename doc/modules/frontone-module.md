FrontOne module
===================
2016-12-25



**FrontOne** is the first module which creates a full website (although a simple one) with a front end.

When you activate this module, it creates the website front end for you.

And of course, you can adminster it via the **nullos admin** via a dedicated "Front" section in the left menu.

Here are some characteristics:

- the **nullos admin** and the generated front end are two different applications,
    and they are meant to be served via different host names (i.e. you need one web server configuration per application)
- the front-one front end doesn't need a database to work: it works with the filesystem    
    



The structure generated by the **FrontOne** module goes beyond the limit of the **app-nullos** directory.
Actually, it starts at the project level, which is the parent directory of the **app-nullos** directory.


Here is an overview of the structure generated by the **FrontOne** module.


```txt
- app-nullos/
- app-vitrine-one/
- class-shared/FrontOne/
```


The **app-nullos** directory should be familiar to you by now, since all our work so far has been
done within this directory.

The **app-vitrine-one** directory contains the front end application. It's a full featured
[kif application](https://github.com/lingtalfi/nullos-admin/tree/master/doc/https://github.com/lingtalfi/kif) by itself.

The **class-shared/FrontOne/** directory helps with the communication between the 
front (app-vitrine-one) and the back (app-nullos) applications.

It essentially contains references and methods used by both applications.    



The front end
===============

Searching a front site to integrate, I found this website: https://html5up.net/
which provides free and responsive "contact" websites.

It was perfect for me to start with.

Basically, the whole website is done using one html page, and using tabs magic
to navigate through the different tabs of the site.

In my implementation, I focused on 3 things:

- the default theme
    - the icon at the top of the welcome page
    - the text on the welcome page
    - anything that belongs to the theme will go here
- the articles
    - they show up in the menu, and if you click them, the page appears in a fancy dialog
- the social links in the contact form    
    

I called each tab an "Article", because of the html tag that was enclosing
their html code.

The articles can be created/removed/edited via the back end.

Also, there is a diamond icon at the top of the website


The contact form
--------------------

One of the page of the front end is a contact form.
The contact form is fully functional.

It basically check that there is an arobase in the email, and that the name is not empty.

All those checkings are done directly inside the template, quick and dirty, but that's actually adapted for 
this kind of website I believe.


It uses the SwiftMailer class under the hood.
The params of the mailer are defined in the application init (**app-vitrine-one/init.php**).






The back end
===============

The back end is composed of three pages, accessible via the "Front" section in the left menu:

- [Theme](https://github.com/lingtalfi/nullos-admin/tree/master/doc/modules/frontone-module/theme-page.md)
- [Articles](https://github.com/lingtalfi/nullos-admin/tree/master/doc/modules/frontone-module/articles-page.md)
- [Social links](https://github.com/lingtalfi/nullos-admin/tree/master/doc/modules/frontone-module/social-page.md)
